## Architecture

The application consists of:
* `app/Api.js` - A private, consumer agnostic API layer that handles all domain logic
* `app/Server.js` - A public-facing RESTFul API that consumes Api.js

## Tests

This application was written using the BDD (Behaviour Driven Development) methodology with Mocha and Chai frameworks, see `test/apiTests.js`

* `npm run test` to execute tests
* `npm run cover` to check test coverage
